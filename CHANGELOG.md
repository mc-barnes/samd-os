## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-30

### Added

- cybersecurity-reviewer agent persona (`.claude/skills/agents/cybersecurity-reviewer/`) ��� Medical device cybersecurity specialist covering FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance (2023), Section 524B, AAMI TIR57, IEC 81001-5-1, with 8 evaluation dimensions
- qa-reviewer agent persona (`.claude/skills/agents/qa-reviewer/`) — ISO 13485 QMS compliance reviewer with 8 evaluation dimensions
- safety-reviewer agent persona (`.claude/skills/agents/safety-reviewer/`) — Patient safety and human factors specialist covering ISO 14971, IEC 62366-1, AI/ML output safety, with 7 evaluation dimensions
- Cybersecurity section in regulatory-reviewer covering FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance (2023), SBOM, AAMI TIR57, IEC 81001-5-1
- AI disclaimer on all agent review outputs (regulatory, clinical, QA, safety, cybersecurity)
- Jurisdiction statement (FDA only) on regulatory-reviewer outputs
- 3 cybersecurity reference docs in `references/cybersecurity/` (FDA cybersecurity FAQ, 524B select updates, postmarket guidance)
- Test fixtures in `examples/test-fixtures/` — 4 deliberately broken SaMD artifacts for validating regulatory-reviewer agent detection
- DEC-001 review-panel orchestration decision stub in `team/decisions/`
- `team/specs/` directory for completed specification documents
- CHANGELOG.md (this file)
- Risk acceptability matrix extracted to `regulatory/risk-management/risk-acceptability-matrix-v1.md`

### Changed

- ALARP → AFAP rename in risk-management skill (ISO 14971:2019 alignment)
- Standards editions pinned in root CLAUDE.md (IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015, ISO 14971:2019/EN, etc.)
- FMEA/RPN explicitly scoped as process FMEA with ISO 14971:2019 Annex G citation
- Clinical-reviewer reframed away from named-person impersonation to RPM pattern
- Regulatory-reviewer citation accuracy: "six traceability chains" reframed as industry best practice; software hazard probability softened from universal rule to common approach
- `status.sh` simplified: frontmatter-based filtering replaces hardcoded filename exclusions; test fixtures excluded
- SPEC.md moved from root to `team/specs/regulatory-reviewer-agent-v1.md` with frontmatter
