## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured
- Python 3.9+ (for XLSX/JSON generation scripts)
- `openpyxl` package: `pip install openpyxl`

### Install All Skills

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mc-barnes/pm-os.git
cd pm-os

# Copy regulatory skills
cp -r skills/samd-regulatory/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy PM skills
cp -r skills/samd-pm/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy agent personas
cp -r skills/agents/* ~/.claude/skills/agents/

# Copy Eleanor Health AI skills
cp -r skills/eleanor-health ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Install Individual Skills

```bash
# Just design controls
cp -r skills/samd-regulatory/design-controls ~/.claude/skills/

# Just FHIR builder
cp -r skills/samd-regulatory/fhir-builder ~/.claude/skills/

# Just the clinical reviewer agent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/agents
cp -r skills/agents/clinical-reviewer ~/.claude/skills/agents/
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Instructions Claude reads when triggered
├── references/       # Standard excerpts, taxonomy files (regulatory skills)
└── scripts/          # Python generators for XLSX/JSON output (regulatory skills)
```

PM skills (`samd-pm/`) contain only `SKILL.md` — they're prompt-based, not script-based.

Eleanor Health skills (`eleanor-health/`) contain `SKILL.md` + `references/`. The `ai-vendor-eval` skill also includes `scripts/` for XLSX scorecard generation.

## Generating Artifacts

The regulatory skills include Python scripts that generate XLSX or JSON output:

```bash
# Design controls traceability matrix
python skills/samd-regulatory/design-controls/scripts/generate_design_controls.py --example spo2

# Risk management FMEA
python skills/samd-regulatory/risk-management/scripts/generate_risk_analysis.py --example spo2

# FHIR R4 bundle
python skills/samd-regulatory/fhir-builder/scripts/generate_fhir_bundle.py --example spo2

# Change impact report
python skills/samd-regulatory/change-impact/scripts/analyze_change_impact.py --example spo2

# Design review package
python skills/samd-regulatory/design-review/scripts/package_design_review.py --review-type CDR --example spo2

# AI vendor evaluation scorecard
python skills/eleanor-health/ai-vendor-eval/scripts/generate_vendor_eval.py --example eleanor
```

See `examples/` in the repo root for pre-generated sample outputs.
