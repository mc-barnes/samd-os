# SaMD Team OS

A Team OS built for SaMD. One mind across every function. Ship regulated software at startup speed.

One repo your whole team works in — product, regulatory, clinical, engineering, and quality. Claude Code navigates the structure, generates regulatory artifacts (IEC 62304, ISO 14971, FDA guidance), and encodes your QMS workflows so nobody re-explains the device.

Every folder has a `CLAUDE.md` navigation map. Claude reads the root on every session and only loads deeper context when a query targets that domain — keeping context usage under 5% for most operations.

| Safety Reviewer | Patient safety and human factors. Reviews risk analysis files, FMEA quality, use-related risk analysis, usability engineering files, foreseeable misuse, and AI/ML output safety. | ISO 14971:2019, IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020, FDA Human Factors guidance, AAMI TIR57. |
| Cybersecurity Reviewer | Medical device cybersecurity. Reviews threat models, cybersecurity risk assessments, SBOMs, security architecture views, security controls, penetration test reports, vulnerability management plans, and Section 524B compliance. | FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance (2026), FDA Postmarket Cybersecurity Guidance (2016), FD&C Act Section 524B, AAMI TIR57, IEC 81001-5-1, NIST CSF. Backed by 3 reference docs. |

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mc-barnes/pm-os.git
cd pm-os
```

### 2. Customize the root CLAUDE.md

Open `CLAUDE.md` and replace the `[placeholders]` with your team's details:
- Team roster (names, roles, Slack/GitHub handles)
- Communication channels
- Device context (classification, predicate, standards, clinical domain)

### 3. Start using skills

Skills are auto-discovered by Claude Code from `.claude/skills/`. Just say the trigger phrase:

```
> "Generate design controls for our cardiac monitor, safety class C"
> "Write a PRD for the new alarm management feature"
> "Run a risk analysis for the SpO2 threshold change"
```

### 4. Fill in templates

Each content folder has `_TEMPLATE.md` files with YAML frontmatter pre-configured (`type`, `status: draft`, `owner`). Copy a template, rename it, and fill in the `[brackets]`:

```bash
cp product/prds/_TEMPLATE.md product/prds/alarm-management-v2.md
```

### 5. Check document status

Run the status generator to see what's draft, in-review, approved, or stale:

```bash
./scripts/status.sh    # generates STATUS.md from frontmatter
```

## Example Artifacts

The `examples/` folder contains pre-generated artifacts using a neonatal pulse oximeter as the reference device:

| File | Skill Used | Contents |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `design-controls-example.xlsx` | Design Controls | Full UN → DI → DO → V&V traceability matrix |
| `risk-analysis-example.xlsx` | Risk Management | Hazard analysis + FMEA with RPN calculations |
| `fhir-bundle-example.json` | FHIR Builder | FHIR R4 bundle with Patient + Observation resources |
| `samd-prd-example.md` | PRD Writer (SaMD) | Product requirements with regulatory sections |
| `change-impact-example.xlsx` | Change Impact | Software change impact with re-verification scope |
| `design-review-example.xlsx` | Design Review | CDR gate package with GO/NO-GO recommendation |

> **Regulatory note:** Skill-generated XLSX and JSON files are **uncontrolled drafts** — no audit trail, no electronic signatures, no Part 11 / Annex 11 compliance. Final approved records belong in your eQMS of record (e.g., Greenlight Guru, MasterControl, Qualio). Position these outputs as working drafts that feed your controlled document system.

## Context Management

SaMD Team OS uses tiered context loading to keep Claude Code efficient:

| Tier | What | When Loaded | Example |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Root `CLAUDE.md` | Every session | Doc index, team roster, device context |
| **Tier 2** | Folder `CLAUDE.md` | When Claude navigates to that folder | `regulatory/CLAUDE.md` loaded on a risk question |
| **Tier 3** | Templates and documents | On demand when referenced | `regulatory/risk-management/_TEMPLATE.md` |

A query about customers loads `product/CLAUDE.md` and relevant customer files — it never touches `analytics/`, `engineering/`, or `regulatory/`. This keeps context usage minimal and responses focused.

## Built with Claude Code

This repo was built entirely with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — from the skill authoring to the folder architecture to this README.

**Companion project**: [spo2-eval-pipeline](https://github.com/mc-barnes/spo2-eval-pipeline) — an end-to-end AI evaluation pipeline for neonatal SpO2 monitoring, also built with Claude Code.
