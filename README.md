# SaMD Team OS

For teams shipping regulated software without a 30-person QMS organization. Five reviewer agents catch findings before auditors do. Standards editions pinned (IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015, ISO 14971:2019, IEC 81001-5-1:2021). Outputs are explicit drafts — your eQMS remains the system of record.

*Ship regulated software at startup speed.*

## Scope and Limitations

Skill-generated XLSX, JSON, and Markdown files are **uncontrolled drafts** — no audit trail, no electronic signatures, no Part 11 / Annex 11 compliance. Final approved records belong in your eQMS of record (e.g., Greenlight Guru, MasterControl, Qualio). This repo is a **working environment**, not a quality system.

## What's Included

### Reviewer Agents (`.claude/skills/agents/`)

Five specialist reviewers that operate from a defined regulatory or clinical perspective. Each is a standalone `SKILL.md` — clone the folder, swap the domain knowledge, and you have a new reviewer for your vertical.

| Agent | Reviews | Standards | Verdicts |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Regulatory Reviewer | PRDs, design controls, risk docs, submissions, change requests | IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015, ISO 14971:2019, ISO 13485:2016, IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020, FDA guidance | ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS REVISION / NOT SUBMITTABLE |
| QA Reviewer | CAPA records, complaint files, audit findings, supplier evaluations, management reviews | ISO 13485:2016, 21 CFR 820, ISO 19011:2018 | AUDIT-READY / NEEDS REMEDIATION / NOT AUDIT-READY |
| Safety Reviewer | Risk analysis, FMEA, use-related risk, usability files, AI/ML output safety | ISO 14971:2019, IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020, FDA Human Factors guidance | ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS REVISION / SAFETY CONCERN |
| Cybersecurity Reviewer | Threat models, SBOMs, security architecture, pen test reports, vulnerability management | FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance (2025), Section 524B, AAMI TIR57:2016, IEC 81001-5-1:2021 | ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS REVISION / SECURITY CONCERN |
| Clinical Reviewer | Clinical logic, alarm management, triage accuracy, handoff quality | Published neonatal literature, AAP guidelines, NRP protocols | ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS REVISION / CLINICALLY UNSAFE |

#### What the agents actually catch

**Regulatory Reviewer** — BLOCKER:
> Intended use statement does not specify patient population, clinical condition, or use setting. Per 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5), indications for use must define population, anatomy, and clinical condition. Predicate selection cannot be validated as written. → *NOT SUBMITTABLE*

**Cybersecurity Reviewer** — SECURITY FINDING:
> SBOM lists 47 components with no version numbers. Section 524B(b)(3) requires versions for vulnerability tracking. Without versions, CVE monitoring is impossible — Log4Shell demonstrated the criticality of transitive dependency tracking. → *SECURITY CONCERN*

**QA Reviewer** — OBSERVATION:
> Management review minutes record "Reviewed and acknowledged" for all agenda items but no decisions. ISO 13485:2016 §5.6.3 requires actionable output — resource allocation, improvement actions, QMS changes. Five of fourteen required §5.6.2 inputs are missing. → *NEEDS REMEDIATION*

**Safety Reviewer** — GAP:
> Risk controls jump directly to IFU warnings without documenting why inherent safety and protective measures are infeasible. ISO 14971:2019 §7.1 requires the hierarchy — inherent safety first, then protective measures, then information for safety — with departures justified. → *NEEDS REVISION*

**Clinical Reviewer** — Note:
> Alarm threshold documentation references "standard neonatal ranges" without citing the specific reference population. Pinning to published cohort data (e.g., Castillo et al. 2008 for preterm, Dawson et al. 2010 for transitional SpO2) strengthens the clinical justification during FDA review. → *ACCEPTABLE with note*

## Example Artifacts

The `examples/` folder contains pre-generated artifacts using a neonatal pulse oximeter as the reference device. The neonatal SpO2 device used throughout these examples is built and documented in [spo2-eval-pipeline](https://github.com/mc-barnes/spo2-eval-pipeline).

```

Every folder has a `CLAUDE.md` navigation map. Claude reads the root on every session and only loads deeper context when a query targets that domain — keeping context usage under 5% for most operations.

### Context Management

| Tier | What | When Loaded | Example |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Root `CLAUDE.md` | Every session | Doc index, team roster, device context |
| **Tier 2** | Folder `CLAUDE.md` | When Claude navigates to that folder | `regulatory/CLAUDE.md` loaded on a risk question |
| **Tier 3** | Templates and documents | On demand when referenced | `regulatory/risk-management/_TEMPLATE.md` |

A query about customers loads `product/CLAUDE.md` and relevant customer files — it never touches `analytics/`, `engineering/`, or `regulatory/`. This keeps context usage minimal and responses focused.

## Getting Started

**Try it now:** Clone the repo, open Claude Code, and say *"Run a risk analysis for a neonatal SpO2 threshold change."* The Risk Management skill generates a hazard analysis worksheet with hazard → sequence of events → harm columns, severity/probability scoring, and risk control traceability — ready to drop into your eQMS as a draft.

### 1. Fork this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mc-barnes/samd-os.git
cd samd-os
```

### 2. Customize the root CLAUDE.md

Open `CLAUDE.md` and replace the `[placeholders]` with your team's details:
- Team roster (names, roles, Slack/GitHub handles)
- Communication channels
- Device context (classification, predicate, standards, clinical domain)

### 3. Start using skills

Skills are auto-discovered by Claude Code from `.claude/skills/`. Just say the trigger phrase:

```
> "Generate design controls for our cardiac monitor, safety class C"
> "Write a PRD for the new alarm management feature"
> "Run a risk analysis for the SpO2 threshold change"
```

### 4. Fill in templates

Each content folder has `_TEMPLATE.md` files with YAML frontmatter pre-configured (`type`, `status: draft`, `owner`). Copy a template, rename it, and fill in the `[brackets]`:

```bash
cp product/prds/_TEMPLATE.md product/prds/alarm-management-v2.md
```

### 5. Check document status

Run the status generator to see what's draft, in-review, approved, or stale:

```bash
./scripts/status.sh    # generates STATUS.md from frontmatter
```
